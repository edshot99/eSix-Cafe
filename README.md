# Calm-e621-e926

A comprehensive restyle of e621, made to be easier on the eyes while being compatible with the userscript "re621"~

# Notes

This theme was designed with the re621 userscript in mind. I cannot guaruntee that this theme will work as intended if you aren't using re621.
<br>To install re621 look here: https://e621.net/forum_topics/25872 (like frfr install it, it's pretty sick n stufffff)

**This theme is 100% NOT fully complete,** however it is in a state where it's basically 99% of the way there.
<br> There's probably gonna be a small hiccup here and there with an element that isn't getting styled or something. see below on how you can help with those~
