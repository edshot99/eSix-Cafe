# Notes

<li>This theme was designed with the re621 userscript in mind. Should work mostly fine without, tho it is recommended.
<br>To install re621 look <a href="https://e621.net/forum_topics/25872">here~</a> (like frfr install it, it's pretty sick n stufffff)</li>
<li>
   
**This theme is *mostly* complete at this point.** 
<br> There's probably gonna be a small hiccup here and there with an element that isn't getting styled or something. See below on how you can help with those~

***This started out as a fun little pet project***
<br> So the code is fairly messy, even after a rewrite lolll </sup>

</li>

# (very) Brief list of main featuressssss

  <li>Customizable Deleted and Blacklisted placeholders (per theme, via the respective theme's :root section~)</li>
  <li>Profile page overhaul</li>
  <li>Large, space taking (Learn more) links changed to a simple question mark SVG<br>(see: search bar in the posts page preview~)</li>
  <li>Re621 post preview favorite icon changed to a heart</li>
  <li>e621 "logo" changed to be, y'know, a logo~</li>
  <li>Something most other styles don't support, full compatibility with e6's built in themes!
  <br> I tried to make them all useable on their own, though I decided to completely replace hotdog with a lil somethin' I call "Hot-Coffee" x3
