# Notes
- The colorful nav bar links isn't because of this style, it's because of re621!
- This is made to be used in combination with Re621, check it out [here!](https://e621.net/forum_topics/25872)
- This is mostly finished! At this point it's mostly being maintained to keep up with e621's updates, with bigger updates coming when I get inspiredddd!
- Mind the old and kinda messy code, I tried to comment any important info that you'd want to change in order to make it relatively easy to find at leasttt!

  If you see an element that is unstyled, or if a styled element is behaving in a way that it shouldn't be,
  Create an issue! I usually try to deal with 'em pretty quicklyyyyyy!
