# Notes

<li>This theme was designed with the re621 userscript in mind. I cannot guaruntee that this theme will work as intended if you aren't using re621.
<br>To install re621 look <a href="https://e621.net/forum_topics/25872">here~</a> (like frfr install it, it's pretty sick n stufffff)</li>
<li>
   
**This theme is 100% NOT fully complete,** however it is in a state where it's basically 99% of the way there.
<br> There's probably gonna be a small hiccup here and there with an element that isn't getting styled or something. see below on how you can help with those~

***This started out as a fun little pet project***
